## Target topics, relevant examples

- CMOP's NCEI netcdf files
- NCEI netcdf templates
- The last examples of Craig's NANOOS NDBC climatology/anomaly netcdf files, from 2015 Nov (see [issue #3](https://github.com/nanoos-pnw/site-timeseries/issues/3) and other files in this repo)
- OceanSITES
- Compliance Checker tests. The compliance checker has undergone major updates in the last 13 months! Better error/warning reporting?
- THREDDS implementations
  - eg, going from CMOP NCEI files (per site-instrument-deployment) to more aggregated, user-friendly views using ncml?
