# Notes for 2017-1-18 meeting

## Target topics, relevant examples

- See previous notes ([notes.md](notes.md) and [nov15_meeting_notes.md](nov15_meeting_notes.md)). Lots of relevant notes and links in there. Some may be outdated, though
- Which CDM DSG (feature type) pattern to use? Is a single pattern good for all use cases?
- CMOP's NCEI netcdf files
- NCEI netcdf templates
- The last examples of Craig's NANOOS NDBC climatology/anomaly netcdf files, from 2015 Nov (see [issue #3](https://github.com/nanoos-pnw/site-timeseries/issues/3) and [ndbcnc folder](ndbcnc) in this repo)
- OceanSITES
- Compliance Checker tests. The compliance checker has undergone major updates in the last 13 months! Better error/warning reporting?
- THREDDS implementations
  - eg, going from CMOP NCEI files (per site-instrument-deployment) to more aggregated, user-friendly views using ncml?
  - for NANOOS NDBC files

## Narrow technical topics
- create and distribute single conda environment to include everything we need (ask Don to do this). xarray, netcdf4, compliance checker ("cc"), cc NCEI plugin?, jupyter, etc. See my 2015-11 `ioos_compcheck` env, originally created like this: `conda create -n ioos_compcheck python=2.7 compliance-checker`. See also these other envs: beth_basic, beth_basic_gen, dmac_cmop_nov15. Do we need to install a cc plugin? If so, how?
- xarray: CF and other standard-compliance gotchas (we can refer to Beth's glider DAC code)
